WP-Bootstrap2
=============

Introduction
============

This project comes with a story:

So here I was looking to launch a new WordPress hosting service and wanting a responsive theme.

I stumbled upon
[Responsive]( http://themeid.com/responsive-theme/) and
[Skeleton]( http://github.com/simplethemes/skeleton_wp)
and loved them both... so I ran with that for a while. A few weeks on and happen upon
Konstantin Obenland's [The-Bootstrap]( http://en.wp.obenland.it/the-bootstrap/),
liked it _\(alot - even tried to contribute to it\)_, researched the core framework; [Twitter's Bootstrap]( http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/) and I was hooked!

But, like politics, the software realm is rife with stubborn positions based on personal opinions.
Me, I started coding in the 80's - so I may well be right up there in the ranking of block headed code churners
_\(but that in itself is an opinion\)_. So even though Bootstrap itself was flawless _\(read bit above on opinions\)_,
I could not settle for the best of the WordPress Theme derivatives... including some excellent work from Rachel Baker and
her [BootstrapWP](http://rachelbaker.me/bootstrapwp-theme-twitter-bootstrap-for-wordpress/) and other also-good themes, like:
320press [WordPress Bootstrap]( http://320press.com/wpbs/),
[wpboostrap]( http://wpbootstrap.iubenda.com/),
[Bootstrap-Wordpress]( http://github.com/envex/Bootstrap-WordPress),
[Bootstrap-for-WordPress]( http://github.com/enile8/Bootstrap-for-WordPress),
[Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/) and
[Ascensor](http://bragthemes.com/theme/ascensorpress/).

Each had its goods and its little things that I wished were different.

And so - like most coders out there - I thought I could do better myself... and starting from
Automattic's [_S](http://github.com/Automattic/_s)
this is the result _\(read bit about opinions above again - I'm probably the only person who thinks this code is any good at all\)_.

Use it as you wish _\(you're probably restricted to Bootstrap's \([`Apache2`](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\) and Worpress' \([`GPLv2`](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\) licences\)_, but its intent is to be out there as a learning aid for aspiring
PHP Wordpress coders.
